# Planet On Fire!

Visit dataplanet.info
With the number of bush fires in the year 2019 and it's devostating after effects in Australia, the idea of obeservating the current fire occurances around the world, capturing the media using Twitter news feeds and analysis of historical fire data for all the continents is tranformed into a dashboard for the end user. Moreover, historical fire data was interpreted to find anomalies and created machine learning model to predict the instances of the bush fires in Australia for the year 2020. 

### Server Code: [Git Repo] (https://github.com/ireneshtepa/Project_planet_on_fire) 

## Features

- **Dashboard:** Planet On Fire is a resource that visualizes semi-real time global fire data on the world map. Navigation allows you to zoom-in on different continents to see the fire heatmap in more detail.
- **Global Fire News:** Current Twitter news feeds
- **Stats:** Graphs based on historical data where a user can also navigate through each continent and see monthly or yearly data 
- **Predictions:** With help of machine learning models predictions were made to estimate future wildfires in Australia
- **Data:** Page includes links to data sources as well as restful APIs created for this project. 
- **Developers:** Pageage introduces you to the team that created this resource.
